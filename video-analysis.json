The timestamps run from `00:00` to `00:10`.\n\n**2) Resolution**\nThe aspect ratio is square (1:1). Visually, the quality suggests a resolution of either **720x720** or **1080x1080**. This is a common format for social media feeds (like Instagram or Facebook), though it is less common for traditional raw drone footage, suggesting it has likely been cropped or edited for mobile viewing.\n\n**3) Key Visual Content for Poster Frame Extraction**\nA poster frame is the static image shown before the video plays. The goal is to choose a frame that clearly communicates the setting and subject.\n\n*   **Recommendation:** The frame at **00:02** or **00:06** is ideal.\n*   **Reasoning:**\n    *   **Context:** It provides a clear aerial view establishing the agricultural setting (patches of tilled earth and green crops).\n    *   **Subject:** It clearly shows the two white buses and the group of people walking along the dirt road.\n    *   **Composition:** The diagonal line of the road creates a strong leading line through the image, making it visually engaging compared to the more zoomed-in or abstract shots later in the clip.\n\n**4) Best Compression Approach for Mobile Web Background Video**\nFor a mobile web background, the priority is fast loading and smooth playback without consuming excessive user data, while maintaining decent visual quality on small screens.\n\n*   **Codec:** **H.264 (AVC)** or **H.265 (HEVC)**. H.264 has the widest compatibility, while H.265 offers better compression (smaller file size) at the same quality but has slightly less browser support. A web-optimized **WebM (VP9)** version is also excellent as a fallback.\n*   **Bitrate:** Target a variable bitrate (VBR) between **1.5 Mbps to 2.5 Mbps**. Since there is moderate motion (drone panning), going too low will cause pixelation in the complex textures of the grass and dirt.\n*   **Resolution:** Resize the video to **720x720** or even **540x540**. On a mobile screen, users won't notice the difference between 1080p and 720p for a background element, but the file size savings will be massive.\n*   **Audio:** **Remove audio tracks completely.** Background videos usually autoplay muted, and stripping the audio track reduces file size.\n*   **Frame Rate:** Reduce to **24fps** or **25fps**. High frame rates (60fps) are unnecessary for background ambience and increase file size."}}, "filename": "gHnjAxhD", "file_size": 0, "file_type": "video", "analysis_type": "unknown", "extracted_metadata": {}}
